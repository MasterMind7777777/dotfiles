# Cyberpunk Vibrant Realistic Wallpaper — Portrait (Left Monitor)

Purpose: evoke a “cool”, emotionally positive, vibrant future on a darker base, while staying readable behind semi‑transparent windows. For the vertical/left display.

- Target size to generate: 1024x1536 (portrait)
- Generate exactly one image at exactly 1024x1536. No variants.
- Final use: upscale/crop minimally to 1200x1920 (rotated)
- Center safe‑zone: keep a central vertical band (~70% width) calm (lower detail/contrast) to not fight foreground text

Palette (from waybar/cyberpank.css):
- Base/surfaces: `#0d0b1a`, `#151028`, `#0a0913`, `#1e1a30`, `#2a2344`, `#3a305c`
- Text/subtle: `#e6e6f0`, `#a8a4c5`, `#c2bfe0`, `#54497a`, `#6b5da3`, `#8276c0`
- Neon accents (sparingly): `#f8f32b`, `#ff2e88`, `#d12cff`, `#28e0f7`, `#00f0ff`, `#8c3cff`, `#ff3a3a`, `#ff7b42`, `#3effb5`

Copy/paste prompt for GPT image:

Generate exactly one image at exactly 1024x1536 resolution (portrait). Create a realistic, high‑detail scene that feels aspirational, energetic, and “cool” — vibrant yet controlled — not dystopian, not sad. Use these hexes for the background and surfaces: #0d0b1a, #151028, #0a0913, #1e1a30, #2a2344, #3a305c. Use neon accents sparingly at the far left/right edges (avoid the center): #f8f32b, #ff7b42, #ff2e88, #28e0f7, #00f0ff, #ff3a3a.

Style and mood: crisp, clear air (no rain), dry materials, clean reflections, premium modern textures, subtle parallax depth, dynamic vertical rhythm. Color grading: luminous, fresh, optimistic on a darker base. Avoid grit, decay, smoke, grime, or bleakness.

Composition: a tall facade rhythm or narrow corridor with layered light panels and glass; concentrate focal accents and dense detail along the far edges; keep a central vertical safe‑zone (~70% width) with soft gradients and minimal hard edges so code/text remains readable.

Readability constraints: no characters, no logos, no UI, no readable text; avoid bright hotspots or large high‑contrast shapes within the central safe‑zone; keep brightest whites subtle (≤ #e6e6f0) except tiny edge glints. Output a clean, frameless wallpaper.

Notes for post‑processing (applied later): upscale to 1200x1920 after rotation with minimal crop; do not boost global contrast; preserve the safe‑zone calm.
