# Cyberpunk Vibrant Realistic Wallpaper — Landscape (Front Monitor)

Purpose: evoke a “cool”, emotionally positive, vibrant future on a darker base, while staying readable behind semi‑transparent windows. For the horizontal/front display.

- Target size to generate: 1536x1024 (landscape)
- Generate exactly one image at exactly 1536x1024. No variants.
- Final use: upscale/crop minimally to 1920x1200
- Center safe‑zone: keep the central 60% calm (lower detail/contrast) so it never fights foreground text

Palette (from waybar/cyberpank.css):
- Base/surfaces: `#0d0b1a`, `#151028`, `#0a0913`, `#1e1a30`, `#2a2344`, `#3a305c`
- Text/subtle: `#e6e6f0`, `#a8a4c5`, `#c2bfe0`, `#54497a`, `#6b5da3`, `#8276c0`
- Neon accents (sparingly): `#f8f32b`, `#ff2e88`, `#d12cff`, `#28e0f7`, `#00f0ff`, `#8c3cff`, `#ff3a3a`, `#ff7b42`, `#3effb5`

Copy/paste prompt for GPT image:

Generate exactly one image at exactly 1536x1024 resolution (landscape). Create a realistic, high‑detail scene that feels aspirational, energetic, and “cool” — vibrant yet controlled — not dystopian, not sad. Base the background and surfaces on deep indigo/purple hexes: #0d0b1a, #151028, #0a0913, #1e1a30, #2a2344, #3a305c. Use neon accents sparingly to add vibrancy near the outer edges and corners (avoid the center): #f8f32b, #ff7b42, #ff2e88, #28e0f7, #00f0ff, #ff3a3a.

Style and mood: crisp, clear air (no rain), dry materials, clean reflections, premium modern architecture, polished glass and brushed metal, subtle parallax layers, dynamic perspective lines. Color grading: luminous, fresh, optimistic on a darker base. Avoid grit, decay, smoke, grime, or bleakness.

Composition: position focal accents and denser detail toward the left/right edges and along the top/bottom borders; keep the central 60% as a safe‑zone with soft gradients and minimal hard edges so code/text stays readable. Encourage diagonal light fins, gentle motion light streaks only at the periphery, and layered depth cues.

Readability constraints: no characters, no logos, no UI, no readable text; avoid bright hotspots or large high‑contrast shapes inside the central safe‑zone; keep brightest whites subtle (≤ #e6e6f0) except tiny glints at the very edges. Output a clean, frameless wallpaper.

Notes for post‑processing (applied later): upscale to 1920x1200 with minimal crop; do not boost global contrast; keep the safe‑zone calm.
